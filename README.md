Repository for Challenge Three of the UCD Bootcamp.
Included in this repository is a password generator.
To generate a password a series of prompts deploy to help the user select the criteria they want.
To start the prompt asks the user the number of characters they want in their password ranging from 8 to 128 characters.
If no answer is given the user is told that they cannot proceed without specifying the amount of characters they want.

Then prompt asks the user if they want lowercase letters in their password (eg. abcd).
Then prompt asks the user if they want uppercase letters in their password (eg. ABCD).
Then prompt asks the user if they want numeric characters in their password (eg. 1234).
Then prompt asks the user if they want special characters in their password (eg. !@#$).

When user chooses the criteria they want along with the amount of characters they want, it is displayed at the bottom of page inside the box. 
If no criteria is chosen and the user proceeds without specifying what character they want added they are prompted and told that they must choose at least one type of character.
